</div>

Mohammad Al Hallaq is a Frontend Developer with over 5 years of experience building intuitive and high-performance user interfaces. His primary tools include React and TypeScript (his favorite), and he takes pride in crafting clean, maintainable, and visually appealing UIs. Over the past two years, Mohammad has expanded his focus to software engineering, diving deeper into backend development, software processes, and project management. This shift has allowed him to approach development from a more holistic perspective, ensuring scalable and efficient solutions.

Mohammad is passionate about open-source projects, though his interests have evolved. While he remains inspired by the Github community and their innovative solutions, he is now more drawn to projects that aim to improve society and enhance people's lives. He is particularly fascinated by AI, big data, and the power of transforming complex, messy information into readable, actionable insights that can drive meaningful change.

He believes that programming is the ultimate tool for shaping the world, with people and information as the raw materials. Projects involving maps, time-related data, and big data visualization excite him, as they help make our world more understandable and actionable.

Mohammadâ€™s mantra remains: "A ship in a harbor is safe, but that is not what ships are built for." He continues to seek opportunities to contribute, collaborate, and make a difference through technology.
