  <h3>About</h3>
</div>

I'm [Mohammad Al Hallaq](https://mohaha.me)  Front End Developer located in Syria
I have a serious passion for UI effects, animations and creating intuitive, dynamic user experiences.
My main experience is in front-end development but I also have a passion for design. Given that producing a modern website requires the combination of design, server technology, and the layer that users interacts with. I believe having experience in both design and development allows for making the most optimal user experiences.
